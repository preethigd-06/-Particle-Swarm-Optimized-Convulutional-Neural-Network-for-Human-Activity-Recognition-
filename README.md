# PSO based Convolutional Neural Network for Physical Human Activity Recognition
Activity Recognition aims at identifying the activity of users based on series of observations collected during the activity in a definite context environment.  Applications that are enabled with activity recognition are gaining huge attention, as users get personalized services and support based on their contextual behaviour. The proliferation of wearable devices and smartphones has provided real-time monitoring of human activities through sensors that are embedded in smart devices such as proximity sensors, cameras, microphone, magnetometers accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS etc., Thus, understanding human activities in inferring the gesture or position has created a competitive challenge in building personal health care systems, examining wellness and fit characteristics, and most pre-dominantly in elderly care, abnormal activity detection, diabetes or epilepsy disorders etc.,
Initially, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) were carried out by attaching one or more dedicated on-body sensors to specific parts of human body to collect data [1–3].  As, the usage of smart phones for daily activities has increased extensively, HAR research has employed to collect data from built-in sensors embedded in smart phones. [4–6].
